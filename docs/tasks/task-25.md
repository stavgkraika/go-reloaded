# Task 25: Performance Optimization

## Description
Optimize FSM performance for large inputs and implement efficient string processing.

## Test First
**TestPerformance**: Large input processing benchmarks

## Implementation Goal
Efficient processing of large text inputs.

## Validation
Performance meets acceptable thresholds.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Process 10KB text in under 100ms
- [ ] Memory usage remains constant for large inputs
- [ ] No memory leaks during processing
- [ ] Benchmark tests pass performance criteria
- [ ] String operations optimized

## Phase
Phase 6 – Advanced Features (Performance)
