# Task 1: Define FSM States and Transitions

## Description
Create enum or constants for Reading, Command, Quote, Punctuation states and implement the basic FSM structure with state transition logic.

## Test First
**TestFSMInitialization**: FSM starts in Reading state, transitions compile correctly

## Implementation Goal
Implement FSM structure with state switch logic that can handle transitions between different states.

## Validation
Transitions trigger as expected when moving between states.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] FSM starts in Reading state
- [ ] State constants/enum defined for all four states
- [ ] Basic transition mechanism implemented
- [ ] State switch logic compiles without errors
- [ ] Tests pass for initial state and basic transitions

## Phase
Phase 1 – Core FSM Setup (Foundation)
